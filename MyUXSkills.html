                <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>We work through the design process to find the best solutions for our user's problems. This includes starting with user research to discover what the issues exist and why. Then, we work with teams to brainstorm every solution to resolve those issues. Finally, we solve the problem using design through programs like Figma.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>We begin our process always with user research. This includes, but is not limited to, user interviews, competitor analysis, user tests, and third party research. We continue user research throughout the entire design process, checking how users respond to our solutions as we create them.</p>

                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                <p>The key to success using the design process is through collaboration with a team of diverse individuals. It is key to be equal parts listerner and contributor when working in a team in this setting. This also includes recognizing when and how to be of service to the team you work on, as well as when to lead and direct.</p>
